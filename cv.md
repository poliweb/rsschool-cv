# Pavel Polistovskiy

**Web Developer**

My competence allows you to start a project with the development of a prototype and design in the Figma tool, deploy and code the project in VS Code, as well as use the Git version control system for the project. To deploy projects on the Internet, I use Netlify and Heroku servers, which allows faster delivery, simplified workflows and easy scaling.
